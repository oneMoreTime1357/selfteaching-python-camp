# day1 excercise was to create hellword.txt file;
## days 2 excercise is creating hell_python.py file;

### day 3 is quite terrible for me, despite the grand tutorial documents reading for me very much and complex, the task of creating a calcuator is like a fairy tale to me, mamamia, i googled, there are some even more completed answer for that, among these one i found, i chose one i could understand more, then try to make it step by step. in the end when i try to execut it on my terminal, it would shut down at the timing point when should come out with the answer of the calculation,mamamia
the answer to me is , i need to read more..

#### day 4, some key words to memorize during the reading:
Labels / Line numbers / identifier
Subroutines/routines, procedures, functions or methods 
imperative programming language VS a declarative programming
Count-controlled loops / Condition-controlled loops/Collection-controlled loops/Infinite loops
(Often, an infinite loop is unintentionally created by a programming error in a condition-controlled loop, wherein the loop condition uses variables that never change within the loop)
for n in set_of_numbers:
    if isprime(n):
        print "Set contains a prime number"
        break
else:
    print "Set did not contain any prime numbers"
The else clause in the above example is linked to the for statement, and not the inner if statement. Both Python's for and while loops support such an else clause, which is executed only if early exit of the loop has not occurred.
Programming language - Python
conditional/ begin-Yes middle-No end-No	
loop /count-No	collection-Yes	general-No infinite-No
early exit -deep nested 
continuation-deep nested
redo-NO  retry-/
correctness facilities: variant-/ invariant-/
